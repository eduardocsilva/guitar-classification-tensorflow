# Guitar Classification (powered by TensorFlow)

Guitar Classification project, powered by a Deep Neural Network model, complete with the model training and a front-end, developed in Python/Jupyter and TypeScript/React.js, respectively.

## 1. Model training

Contains a Jupyer Notebook, a set of already trained models in different formats (e.g. Keras, TensorFlow.js), as well as the training/testing dataset of guitar images.

The obtained deep neural network model is capable of processing an image and classifying the guitar contained in it, with a relatively low 60% accuracy, which can be improved by collecting more data/images for each of the guitar models and finer tuning of the neural network's architecture and training process.

## 2. Front-End

In order to test the trained model, a front-end has been developed in TypeScript and React.js, where the model can be easily deployed thanks to TensorFlow.js.

All you need to test it is an image of a guitar to upload to the website. In fact, I invite you to test it out with a picture of your guitar, preferably an electric Gibson or a Fender guitar, as those are the supported models at the moment.

The website is currently deployed [here](https://eduardocsilva.github.io/guitar-classification-tensorflow), so you don't need to run it locally.

## 3. Contributions

This is a small project that can grow in functionality and become more accurate with a bigger and better dataset, so feel free to contribute in any way you want.
